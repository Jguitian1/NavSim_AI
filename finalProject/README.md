# Installation and Setup

Install [Unity](https://unity.com/download) version LTS 2022.3.16f1  

Download the AIUnity-second directory and add it to your Unity Hub Projects  

Launch the Project through Unity Hub  

Go to Assets/Scenes and double click on SampleScene  

# Launch Either AI Script or Dijkstra Script  

Once inside of the SampleScene, click on the Player GameObject  

To use Dijkstra's Script, drag the 'Pathfinding' Script from Assets/scripts above the AI Pathfinding Script  

Uncheck the AI Pathfinding Script and Check the Pathfinding Script  

Then choose your Start Node, End Node and select the Player GameObject where it says 'Player'  

Adjust the speed to your liking  

To use the AI Pathfinding Script, make sure that AI Pathfinding Q is checked and not 'Pathfinding'  

Choose your starting node and ending node  

Select the PLayer Game Object under where it says Player  

Adjust the rest of the factors to your liking (note* Exploration Rate may be bugged, more troubleshooting is required to confirm)   

# Running the Scripts

Select 'Game' which is located towards the top of the screen  

Then press the Play Button. Dijkstra's Script runs once and then you have to rerun it, the AI script runs until you press stop.
